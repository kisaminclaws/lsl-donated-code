lsl-donated-code
================

This contains code I am donating to the SL community for use in their projects.  Although it is freely available to anyone and everyone who wishes to use it, I do ask that you provide credit to me (Kisamin) in your documentation and that any improvements you make to the code be sent back to me for the use of others.

Sending me some Linden wouldn't annoy me either ;)
