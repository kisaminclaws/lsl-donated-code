lsl-donated-code
================

This contains code I am donating to the SL community for use in their projects.  Although it is freely available to anyone and everyone who wishes to use it, I do ask that you provide credit to me (Kisamin) in your documentation and that any improvements you make to the code be sent back to me for the use of others.

Sending me some Linden wouldn't annoy me either ;)

A lot of this code is created using Eclipse with the LSL-Forge plug in.  As such, the code is uploaded in two forms.  Files with the extention ```.lslp``` are for the Eclipse/LSL-Forge combination and must be pushed through their pre-processor before being uploaded to SL.  Files with the ```.lsl``` extension are capable of being uploaded to SL and used directly.

There are many other authors that contribute code to the SL community.  They all deserve your support too!
